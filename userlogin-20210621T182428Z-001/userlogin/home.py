<h1><b><i><font color="green">Stock market</font></i></b></h1>
<p><font color="blue">A stock market, equity market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks, which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange as well as those only traded privately.</font></p>

<h1><b><i><font color="green">Stock exchange</font></b></i></h1>
<p><font color="blue">A stock exchange, securities exchange or bourse, is a facility where stock brokers and traders can buy and sell securities, such as shares of stock and bonds and other financial instruments.</font></p>

<h1><b><i><font color="green">What Is the Purpose of a Stock Exchange?</font></i></b></h1>
<p><font color="blue">When a business raises capital by issuing shares, the owners of those new shares are likely going to want to sell their stake someday. Maybe they have a child going to college and need to cover the tuition bill. Perhaps they pass away, and their estate is subject to some hefty estate taxes. They may even leave it to their grandchildren, who get to enjoy the stepped-up basis loophole, but the heirs want to liquidate to buy a house. Whatever is driving their decision, they aren't likely to tie up their funds unless they know somehow, someway, at some point in the future, they'll be able to find a buyer for their holdings without too much trouble in what is known as "the secondary market."</font></p>

<h1><b><i><font color="green">What Is the Difference Between a Stock Exchange and a Commodity Exchange?</font></i></b></h1>
<p><font color="blue">A stock exchange is where pieces of ownership in businesses (stocks) are bought and sold among investors.  A commodity exchange is where goods that come from the Earth, such as corn, soybeans, cattle, oil, silver, gold, coffee, and pork bellies are bought and sold among parties, frequently not just for investment purposes but for actual use in business operations.</font></p>
